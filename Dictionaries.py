# Dictionaries and Lists
# Notes about both:
# 1. Both are mutable.
# 2. Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
# 3. Both can be nested.

# Dictionaries differ from lists primarily in how elements are accessed:

# List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
# Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.
